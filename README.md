# Eclipse Hub Issues
Hello! This webpage was created so you can figure out your eclipse hub issues here.<br>Please note that I do not own Eclipse Hub, and this is an unofficial website created by me. Eclipse Hub was created by [£thanoj1#3304](https://discord.com/users/534231910180716565).<br>
If none of these solutions seem to work for you, please contact £thanoj1 for assistance.

## Tips for all issues
Most issues fix themselves after waiting for a few minutes or after retrying.<br>
The hub is only supported by Krnl and Synapse. No other executor supports it as of now.<br>
"Supports" does not mean that the hub won't run, so please make sure you are using the right executor.<br>
Always check the discord and the "scripts" section of the hub to see which games are not patched, as the hub won't load if the script is patched on that game.<br>
If you still can't fix your issue, please join the discord server and state your issue in the `#support` channel.<br><br>

### 1. Hub Not Loading
What you would have to do is try rejoining.<br>
This should fix the issue. If not then it should be your internet connection. Check your internet and try again.<br>
Check the Eclipse discord server for any announcements, the hub might not be working at the moment, or the game script might be patched.<br>
If none of these work, try again later, or wait patiently till it loads.

### 2. Premium Not Loading
This is a common issue. Please make sure that the game you are joining is not patched, or the hub might not load.<br>
If you are a premium user and you do not have the premium perks, try visiting the [Eclipse Hub Website](https://eclipsehub.xyz).<br>
Sign in and look for a button called "GEN SCRIPT". Click that button. The button will copy a loadstring with your key to your clipboard.<br>
If you do not have your key in your loadstring, then refresh the website and try again.<br>
Paste the copied text onto you executor, and execute that. Premium should now load.<br>
If premium still fails to load, click on the "RESET HWID" button. Then try executing again.<br>
If premium still fails to load, please contact [£thanoj1#3304](https://discord.com/users/534231910180716565) through the discord server.<br>
Please do not share your key with anyone else, nor try deleting anything, as you could get blacklisted from using the hub.

### 3. No Premium Badge in the Discord Server
If you are a premium user and you do not have the discord premium role like the others do, simply visit a bot commands channel in the discord and type `!givebuyer`.<br>
The command will give you the premium role. Please note that to get the role you will need to link your discord account to the Eclipse Hub website, so visit the website and click on the "LINK DISCORD" button and link your discord account.

### 4. Cannot join the Eclipse Hub Discord Server
To get in the discord server, you will need to execute the script. In the home page, there should be a discord icon at the top. Click that button to copy your discord invite to the server. Please note that you cannot invite anyone else to the server. If they want to join, they will have to join through the script.

### 5. Roblox error code 268
This is not an Eclipse Hub Issue but I figured, since it's a common issue, to put a fix for it here as well.<br>
To fix the issue, use the shortcut `Windows Key + R` and type `%localappdata%` and press "Ok". Locate a folder called "Roblox". If there is a folder, delete that folder.<br>
If there isn't a folder, then use the shortcut again and type `%appdata%` and press "Ok". Locate a folder called "Roblox". If there is a folder, delete that folder.<br>
Then re install roblox and it should fix the problem.<br>
If none of these work, then just wait 30 minutes and the issue will fix itself.<br><br>

More issues and ways to fix them will be comming soon.
